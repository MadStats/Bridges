###  Bridges of the USA.  
[I think this data is so interesting.](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/ascii.cfm)
When you find some data, you should always look for the [data descriptions](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/mtguide.pdf).  From page 38, we have the ratings of bridge conditions (for Deck, Superstructure, and Substructure), for *every bridge in the US*, for every year back to 1991.  Lots of other data on each bridge (e.g. county FIPS code of the bridge). 




Warm up:  make a file with bridge ID, year, fips codes, condition ratings, and a few other variables that interest you.  Make your code reproducible.  Make a plot.  Things to do first:  (i) look at a few lines of the raw data, (ii) look at the data description.  Work independently, in small groups. (Share ideas and functions, but not code)

Project idea: zoom into a subset of "interesting" bridges (as you define it).  Track how those bridges have changed over time.  Make an interactive visualization that helps you tell a story. This project is definitely not required.  It is just to help give a slightly more concrete example to the question "what do you expect in a project?".
